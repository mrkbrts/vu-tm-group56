    "Analyzing textual data for sentiment, entity recognition, and thematic content has become crucial in the quickly developing field of natural language processing in order to derive useful insights. This research project, takes a comprehensive journey through the analysis of restaurant reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. In this notebook, three Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques will be applied: Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) and Topic Analysis. The goal of sentiment analysis is to classify text as positive, negative or neutral [1]. NERC identifies important entities and classifies them, such as Persons, Location or Date and Time [7]. Topic Analysis can categorize text entries - in the case of LDA - into pre-determined topics [9]."

    "The initial phase of our research project involved looking for a dataset, and preparing that to our NLP analysis. We obtained the \"Restaurant Customer Reviews\" dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vigneshwarsofficial/reviews). This consists of 1000 textual reviews from guests of a single restaurant. Each review was pre-labeled with binary sentiment values - 1 representing positive feedback and 0 stating negative opinions. The distribution between negative and positive reviews were equal, making in a perfectly balanced dataset. This structured dataset served as the foundational corpus for our analysis."

    "The dataset underwent a number of preprocessing processes, which were essential for improving the precision of our NLP models. The binary sentiment labels were converted into two more comprehensible sting entries — \"positive\" and \"negative\" — to start the preprocessing pipeline. We utilized lemmatization to normalize the textual data to handle the variability and complexity of language. Using a WordNetLemmatizer and the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk), every word in the reviews was reduced to its lemma, also known as their basic form. Lemmatization was combined with the removal of unnecessary punctuation, such as commas and periods, and a filtering phase was used to remove any reviews that were empty or irrelevant, guaranteeing that the dataset had no null values. These preparation activities were essential to build a strong basis for the more complex analysis that came after."

By computing the valence ratings of each text input, VADER is designed to analyze text sentiment and determine whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. This method was selected in particular because it is good at managing slang, emoticons, and casual language—all of which are common in restaurant reviews [8].\n",

Tests were carried out to assess how VADER's performance was affected by these selective examination of POS segments, however, these tests did not produce appreciable differences in the result, indicating the robustness of VADER across different textual contexts."

The choice was motivated by RoBERTa's established ability to understand natural language and its adaptability in handling unique classification tasks, allowing a more detailed analysis of sentiment in our datase [3]. The flexibility of RoBERTa was especially helpful in enabling a binary sentiment classification technique that matched the positive and negative labels present in our corpus.\n",

    "We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) through the Gensim library, a recognized method for topic modeling in text corpora, to investigate thematic structures found in restaurant reviews. This methodological decision was based on LDA's demonstrated ability to reveal latent topic distributions in large unstructured text datasets [6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) model was then used to convert the processed documents into a bag-of-words representation and asess the relative value of each term in the corpus to its frequency across documents. This change was essential for improving the topic modeling procedure since it reduced the weight of common but uninformative phrases while highlighting important terms [9].\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Gensim's LDA Multicore model, we were able to extract and analyze ten different subjects from the restaurant evaluations, which formed the basis of our topic analysis. Every topic was represented as a cluster of words along with their corresponding probabilities, which showed how relevant each word was to the subject. The results of this research demonstrated the wide range of topics that consumers focus on in their reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilized pyLDAvis, an interactive visualization tool, to enhance the interpretability of the results of our LDA model. This tool allowed for the easy examination and investigation of the connections between the topics and their distribution across the dataset. The capacity of the model to divide the corpus into logical themes was highlighted by this visual representation."
